# Spatial Feature Engineering for Geomarketing

This is a quick guide for data scientists and analysts on the topic of working with geospatial data.
Geographical information in a dataset it can be used for feature generation and provide statistically important data.
This is called spatial feature engineering. In this guide I mainly focus on geomarketing task, but its concepts can be used in any field.
